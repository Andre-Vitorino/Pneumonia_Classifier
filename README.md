# Pneumonia Classifier 
## Classifying pneumonia from chest x-ray


# 1.0 The contex

## 1.1 What are the complication of pneumonia?

- Low levels of oxygen in blood flows
- Low arterial presure with life risk
- Lung abscess or empyema

Today the diagnosis are made through a doctor or a trained radiologists, and this can be a problem to certain regions of the world.

# 2.0 The Solution

Thinking about this problemns, i decided to make an algorithm to make things more easy for every one. With a pneumonia classifier i dont have to horry about find someone capable of make diagnosis. With this approuch the diagnosis are made more fast, more assertive and less expensive.

## 2.1 How to use this solution?

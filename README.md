# Pneumonia Classifier 
## Classifying pneumonia from chest x-ray


# 1.0 The contex

## 1.1 What are the complication of pneumonia?

- Low levels of oxygen in blood flows
- Low arterial presure with life risk
- Lung abscess or empyema
- Severe lung injury

## 1.2 Facts about pneumonia:

Pneumonia is a very common disease that afect about 450 milions people per year, and occurs in all the world. It is one of the main death causes between all age groups, resulting in 4 million of deaths(7% of all total deaths in the world).

It is 5x more frequently in developing countries than in developed countries, because of nutrition and hygiene conditions.

Today the diagnosis are made through a doctor or a trained radiologists, and this can be a problem to certain regions of the world.

# 2.0 The Solution

Thinking about this problems, I decided to make an algorithm to make things more easy for everyone. With a pneumonia classifier we don't have to worry about find someone capable of make diagnosis. With this approuch the diagnosis are made more fast, more assertive and less expensive.

## 2.1 How to use this solution?

If you want to use this solution, please follow the steps bellow:

1 - Download the Forecast_Pneumonia.ipynb archive
2 - Open it in your favorite code editor
3 - Remember to change the names of paths and images to your own, to avoid errors

## 2.2 What are the expected outputs?

There are two types outputs: Normal and Pneumonia. Like the examples bellow:

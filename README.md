Effectively classifying medical images play an essential role in aiding clinical care and treatment. 
For example, Analysis X-ray is the best approach to diagnose pneumonia which causes about 50,000 people to die per year in the US, 
but classifying pneumonia from chest X-rays needs professional radiologists which is a rare and expensive resource for some regions.

With a image classifier algorithm you don't need to carry about getting help from any health professional to do classifications for you, besides that,
the process is to much quickly and precise than to a manually classification. 

I got this dataset from Klaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

You can train this model with these data and after that use any pneumonia image to do your Diagnosis.

This is the output you should have after run the code on your PC:
